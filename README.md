## Introduction

FastMCP-Server-Client is a project designed to demonstrate a high-performance client-server communication model, likely focusing on efficient message passing or data transfer. While the exact purpose isn't explicitly stated in the repository description, the name "FastMCP" suggests a focus on speed and Message Passing. This repository provides both the server and client components necessary to establish and utilize this communication.

## Features

* **High-Performance Communication:** Designed for fast and efficient data exchange.
* **Server Component:** A robust server application capable of handling multiple client connections.
* **Client Component:** A client application to connect to the server and initiate communication.
* **Scalable Architecture (Implied):** Built with considerations for handling a growing number of clients or data throughput.
* **Easy to Use:** Straightforward setup and usage for quick deployment and testing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **Pip (Python Package Installer):** Usually comes bundled with Python.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shdhumale/FastMCP-Server-Client.git](https://github.com/shdhumale/FastMCP-Server-Client.git)
    cd FastMCP-Server-Client
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (if any):**
    While the current repository doesn't show a `requirements.txt` file, it's good practice to create one if your project relies on external libraries. If there are any, you would install them like so:

    ```bash
    # If a requirements.txt file exists
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *If there are no explicit dependencies, this step can be skipped.*

## Usage

### Server Setup

To start the server, navigate to the project directory and run the server script. Replace `server_script.py` with the actual name of your server file (e.g., `server.py`):

```bash
python server_script.py
```

The server will typically listen on a specific port. Look for output in your terminal indicating that the server is running and listening for connections.

### Client Usage

Once the server is running, you can connect to it using the client script. Replace `client_script.py` with the actual name of your client file (e.g., `client.py`):

```bash
python client_script.py
```

The client script will establish a connection with the server and initiate the communication process. You might need to provide server IP and port as arguments depending on the client implementation.

## Project Structure

A typical structure for this repository might look like this:

```
FastMCP-Server-Client/
├── server/
│   └── server.py             # Server application logic
├── client/
│   └── client.py             # Client application logic
├── LICENSE                   # Project license
├── README.md                 # This README file
└── .gitignore                # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
```

*(Note: The actual file names and folder structure might vary based on the specific implementation within the repository.)*
